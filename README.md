# toggl-for-clients

[Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/) doesn't provide a way to share detailed times to clients, for this reason I created this little web app.

This is a basic node/express application that use [Toggl Reports API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/reports.md), using bootstrap in the frontend.
